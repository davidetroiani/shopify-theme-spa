# shopify-theme-spa
This repository includes a **Shopify theme** that integrates a React app that makes **authorized requests** to a NodeJs app's web service.

## What is it about?
This project shows how to integrate a React single page application in your Shopify theme and make authorized requests to a custom NodeJs app. This way, you can just integrate any app in your Shopify theme and access the currently logged customer to read and manipulate user data with a custom app. User data can be stored in Shopify or anywhere else.

## The demo
The project adds a voucher-validation functionality to a Shopify theme. The validation is made by a remote custom server-side application. The front-end components (a text box and a button) are run by React and the remote application runs NodeJs.

## Installation
To run this project will need:
- [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli)
- A [Shopify partner account](https://partners.shopify.com/signup) and a [development store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/development-stores#create-a-development-store) 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) with npm
- Install *serve* Node package\
`npm i -g serve`

You can find huge documentation on how to install and run the Shopify CLI and how to integrate it with your Shopify store.

## Explanation
The `shopify-theme` folder contains the default Dawn theme (I loaded the whole package so you can just clone the repo and run it). I added a new section ("sections/voucher-check.liquid" file). The section is then added to the home page by configuring the templates/index.json file.

The `react-app` folder contains a small React project with a single component with a dummy feature. The `App.js` file contains the logic that calls the remote web service by appending two headers used for authorization by the NodeJs app.

The `node-app` folder contains a small NodeJs project that exposes a web service that validates the authorization headers and sends back a dummy response. The `index.js` file contains the web service's logic.

## Run the project
1. Install the dependencies for the React app by running `npm i` from the React app root and build it by running `npm run build`.
2. Serve statically the new `build` folder by running `serve build -l 3001` from the React app root.
3. Run `npm i` for the Node app and expose it to the port 3000 by running `node index.js` from its root. The port is set in the `index.js` file.
4. Debug the Shopify theme locally (port 9292). Follow the CLI documentation for more instructions.
5. Sign is as customer and scroll to the middle of the home page: you will find an ugly long text box ending with a "GO!" button. 
6. Type any text and press the button so the web service is called.

Keep the Inspector open and see the requests being sent to the server-side application.

## Further notes
- Feel free to create your own algorithm to generate the hash, as long as both the liquid file and the NodeJs app use the same exact algorithm to generate it. Do not overkill!ðŸ˜‰
- Use the [**Shopify Proxy**](https://shopify.dev/apps/online-store/app-proxies) feature to increase security: it allows you to have your remote web services called directly by Shopify; your front-end app will call Shopify's proxy so your web services' URLs are not exposed to the browser.
- Use SSL.
- Consider **caching** user data in your remote app so you don't have to call Shopify Customer API to query Shopify for the data to validate for every single request.
